### Introduction

#### What is ThunderCore Engine?

ThunderCore is a non-custodial Lightning-as-a-Service (LaaS) for businesses, merchants, and Lightning apps. Your users hold their keys, while we take care of everything else. As a developer building with ThunderCore, you can just talk to our simple API, and seamlessly integrate Lightning payments in your application, without having Lightning protocol expertise, or going about a lengthy node setup.

1. The core two services currently exposed are:
   1. The scheduler which allows users and applications to register new accounts, recover accounts based on the seed secret used to create the account, schedule their node on our infrastructure and look up already scheduled nodes. Scheduling returns a HTTP URI where the node itself can be reached.
   2. The node represents the scheduled user node running, and is used to interact with the RLN instance. It can be used to send and receive payments, manage channels and liquidity.
