ThunderSafe uses client-side encryption, meaning your data is encrypted locally on your device using your seed phrase before being sent to the VSS server. This ensures that even ThunderSafe cannot access your data, maintaining trustlessness. The VSS server ensures data versioning and atomic updates for reliable storage and retrieval.

**4. Why is ThunderSafe ideal for developers using the RGB protocol?**

ThunderSafe simplifies the development process by providing a secure and efficient storage solution for RGB assets and Lightning data. It ensures data availability and recovery across multiple protocols (Lightning, Bitcoin, and Liquid), enabling developers to focus on building robust RGB-based applications without worrying about complex storage implementations.
