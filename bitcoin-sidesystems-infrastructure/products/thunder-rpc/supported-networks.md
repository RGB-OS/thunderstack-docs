# üåê Supported Networks

ThunderStack supports a diverse range of networks, all unified by their reliance on the robust security assumptions provided by Bitcoin and/or BitVM technologies. By integrating these networks, we ensure that our infrastructure inherits the strong decentralization, censorship resistance, and proven security guarantees inherent in Bitcoin's design. This strategic selection allows ThunderStack to deliver secure and scalable solutions tailored specifically for advanced Bitcoin-based Layer-2 ecosystems.
