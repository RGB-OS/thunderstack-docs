# RGB SDK

## SDK Overview

This is the underlying SDK used by RGB client applications. It provides a complete set of TypeScript/Node.js bindings for interacting with the **RGB Node** and managing RGB-based transfers.

> **Note**: This SDK requires an RGB Node instance to function. The RGB Node is a drop-in HTTP service that handles RGB state management, invoice creation, PSBT building, and transfer lifecycle. For more information about setting up and running an RGB Node, see the [RGB-Node repository](https://github.com/RGB-OS/RGB-Node).

***

### üß∞ What You Can Do with This Library

With this SDK, developers can:

* Generate RGB invoices
* Create and manage UTXOs
* Sign PSBTs using local private keys or hardware signing flows
* Fetch asset balances, transfer status, and other RGB-related state

### üß© Notes for Custom Integration

* All communication with the RGB Node is handled via HTTP API calls encapsulated in the `ThunderLink` class.
* The `signPsbt` method demonstrates how to integrate a signing flow using `bdk-wasm`. This can be replaced with your own HSM or hardware wallet integration if needed.
* By using this SDK, developers have full control over:
  * Transfer orchestration
  * UTXO selection
  * Invoice lifecycle
  * Signing policy

This pattern enables advanced use cases, such as:

* Integrating with third-party identity/auth layers
* Applying custom fee logic or batching
* Implementing compliance and audit tracking
