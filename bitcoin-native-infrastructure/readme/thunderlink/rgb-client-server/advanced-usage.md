# Advanced Usage

### Build Your Own RGB Client Server

While the **ThunderLink RGB Client Server** offers a ready-to-deploy backend service with sensible defaults and a full feature set, **advanced users** may choose to build their own custom implementation to better fit their infrastructure, business logic, or deployment model.

To support this, ThunderLink provides the core library: [`rgb-connect-nodejs`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rgb-connect-nodejs).

#### `rgb-connect-nodejs` Library

This is the underlying SDK used by the official RGB Client Server. It provides a complete set of TypeScript/Node.js bindings for interacting with the **ThunderLink RGB Manager** and managing RGB-based transfers.

With this library, developers can:

* Generate RGB invoices&#x20;
* Create and manage UTXOs
* Sign PSBTs using local private keys or hardware signing flows
* Fetch asset balances, transfer status, and other RGB-related state

#### When to Use a Custom Server

You might consider building your own RGB Client Server if:

* You need to integrate with an existing wallet infrastructure
* You want to expose a different API surface to your frontend SDK
* You are integrating deeply with other financial systems or order management logic
* You want to apply non-standard business rules or policy enforcement
* Youâ€™re running a large-scale exchange or payment platform and require full control over infrastructure, monitoring, and debugging

#### RGB Asset Transfer Flow

To send an RGB asset using a PSBT flow:

1. **Prepare Transfer (PSBT):**\
   Call `sendBegin(params)` with a `recipient_map`, fee rate, and optional donation flag. This returns an unsigned PSBT.
2. **Sign PSBT:**\
   Use `signPsbt({ psbtBase64, mnemonic })` to sign the PSBT using the wallet's private key derived from the mnemonic.
3. **Finalize Transfer:**\
   Submit the signed PSBT via `sendEnd({ signed_psbt })` to complete the transfer.

> ðŸ’¡ The `send()` method automates this three-step flow, making it easier to programmatically send assets in one function call. This method is intended to be used **internally on the backend only**, after all transfer requirements (such as sufficient balance, recipient validation, and policy checks) have been verified. It should not be exposed to client-side logic.



#### Notes for Custom Integration

* All communication with the ThunderLink RGB Manager is handled via HTTP API calls encapsulated in the `ThunderLink` class.
* The `signPsbt` method demonstrates how to integrate a signing flow using `bdk-wasm`. This can be replaced with your own HSM or hardware wallet integration if needed.
* By using this SDK, developers have full control over transfer orchestration, UTXO selection, invoice lifecycle, and signing policies.
* This pattern enables advanced use cases, such as integrating with third-party identity/auth layers, batching logic, compliance tracking, or internal audit flows.
